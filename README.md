Introduction

The Vaccine GUI is an interface developed to encourage as many residents as possible to get vaccinated.
The interface is intended to be remotely controlled to display on an electronic billboard, and displays the following:

* The population number, which can be modified as it changes
* The number of residents currently vaccinated, which can be modified as it changes.
* A plus button to quickly increase the number of vaccinated residents by 1
* The percentage of residents currently vaccinated, to two decimal places
* An Enter button, for keyboard entry of population or vaccinated numbers
* An Exit button, to exit the program
